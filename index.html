      Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might </span>
     
      <span data-start="4.130" data-end="7.535">
      connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.</span>
      
      <span data-start="7.535" data-end="11.270">
      Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and </span>
      
      <span data-start="11.270" data-end="13.960">
      most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
      
      </p>

      <p>
      <span data-start="13.960" data-end="17.940">
      Let's look at an example of how
you can connect to the internet.</span>
      
      <span data-start="17.940" data-end="22.370">
      If you live in a city or a town,
you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>
      
      <span data-start="22.370" data-end="26.880">
      cable Internet, or a phone line if you
have DSL, running to the outside of</span>
      
      <span data-start="26.880" data-end="30.920">
      your house, that connects you to
the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span>
      
      <span data-start="32.100" data-end="34.730"> 
      If you live far out in the country,
you'll more likely have </span>
      
      <span data-start="34.730" data-end="39.430">
      a dish outside your house, connecting
you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or </span>
     
      <span data-start="39.430" data-end="41.190">
      you might also use the telephone system.</span>
      
      </p>

      <p>
      <span data-start="42.350" data-end="46.300">
      Whether a wire comes straight from
the ISP hookup outside your house, or 
      </span>
      <span data-start="46.300" data-end="49.270">
      it travels over radio
waves from your roof,
      </span>
      <span data-start="49.270" data-end="53.760">
      the first stop a wire will make once
inside your house, is at your modem.
      </span>
      <span data-start="53.760" data-end="57.780">
      A modem is what connects the internet
to your network at home.

      A few common residential modems are DSL or
